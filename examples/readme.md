# Examples

To play with the examples:

```
npm run example:build # make a build in dist/app/
npm run example:dev   # make a build in dist/app/, and make a live server to access it
```

The _example_:dev\_ task will build the app (without minification), then start a live-server with hot-reloading, and watch the file system to make sure
that assets are properly rebuilt if necessary, and then reloaded.

## Web Client Example

To test and play with the component class, there is a demo application located
in the _examples/web/_ folder. It is a rethink of what the web client could look like
if it is ever rebuilt from scratch. It is currently an experiment. But
obviously, we hope someday to be able to use this work and actually rewrite
completely the odoo web client.

## Demo

This example is just a playground to experiment/showcase some features of
the framework.
