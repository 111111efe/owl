## Overview

[QWeb](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/12.0/reference/qweb.html) is the primary templating engine used by Odoo. It is based on the XML format, and used
mostly to generate html.

Template directives are specified as XML attributes prefixed with `t-`, for instance `t-if` for conditionals, with elements and other attributes being rendered directly.

To avoid element rendering, a placeholder element `<t>` is also available, which executes its directive but doesnâ€™t generate any output in and of itself.

The QWeb implementation in the OWL project is slightly different.  It compiles
templates into functions that output a virtual DOM instead of a string. This is
necessary for the component system.  In addition, it has a few extra directives
(see [OWL Specific Extensions](#owlspecificextensions))

**Note on white spaces:** white spaces in a templates are handled in a special way:

- consecutive whitespaces are always condensed to a single whitespace
- if a whitespace-only text node contains a linebreak, it is ignored
- the previous rules do not apply if we are in a `<pre>` tag
