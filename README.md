## Project Overview

The Odoo Web Library (OWL) is a small 
UI framework intended to be the basis for the [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) Web Client, and hopefully many
other Odoo related projects. OWL's main feature is a _declarative component system_, with QWeb as a template engine, asynchronous rendering, and an underlying virtual dom.

If you are interested, you can find a discussion on what makes OWL different
from React and Vue [here](doc/comparison.md)

## What makes OWL different

- **XML based**: templates are based on the XML format, which allows interesting
  applications.  For example, they could be stored in a database and modified
  dynamically with `xpaths`.
- **templates compilation in the browser**: this may not be a good fit for all
  applications, but if you need to generate dynamically user interfaces in the
  browser, this is very powerful.  For example, a generic form view component
  could generate a specific form user interface for each various models, from a XML view.
- **no toolchain required**: this is extremely useful for some applications, if,
  for various reasons (security/deployment/dynamic modules/specific assets tools),
  it is not ok to use standard web tools based on `npm`.


## Try it online!

An online playground is available at [https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground](https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground) to let you experiment with the OWL framework.

# Example

Here is a short example to illustrate interactive widgets:

```javascript
class ClickCounter extends owl.Component {
  inlineTemplate = `
    <button t-on-click="increment">
      Click Me! [<t t-esc="state.value"/>]
    </button>`;

  state = { value: 0 };

  increment() {
    this.state.value++;
  }
}

const qweb = new owl.QWeb();
const counter = new ClickCounter({qweb});
counter.mount(document.body);
```

More interesting examples can be found on the [playground](https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground) application.
